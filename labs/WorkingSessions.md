## Virtual Working sessions

Virtual working sessions are intended to be virtual, but they could just as easily be done in person. No homework will be given out at these sessions.

* Week 2: [Git practice](https://learngitbranching.js.org) (virtual)
  * Check student's progress prior to class.
  * Start session by checking in and answering any outstanding questions.
  * Introduce *learngitbranching* and start through the material.
    * New topics will include branching, merging, rebasing, ...
  * Do some additional examples in the Planets repository
    * Try to emphasize the big picture
    * Need to decouple the tools from the repository (data in the repo are where the rubber meets the road - SourceTree, GitHub, terminal, and RStudio are just how we interact with the data).
    * Conflicts?
